        <h2>Major Quotes</h2>
        <p>
          "When you make a choice and say, 'Come hell or high water, I am going
          to be this,' then you should not be surprised when you are that. It
          should not be something that is intoxicating or out of character
          because you have seen this moment for so long that ... when that
          moment comes, of course it is here because it has been here the whole
          time, because it has been [in your mind] the whole time."
        </p>
        <p>"The moment you give up is the moment you let someone else win"</p>
        <p>
          "The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they
          can be great at whatever they want to do."
